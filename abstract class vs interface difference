interface vs abstract class:
=============================

main purpose: override (run time polymorphism)

difference:
===========

1)  don't create object for interface & abstract
2)  interface only declare method. but abstract class
    both define(nomarl method) and declare(abstract method).
3) interface varibale define is must. don't change anywhere.
   but abstract variabel define or declare or change anywhere.

4) must use method in dervie interface methods public is must.
   abtract class public is not must.
