- Thread is a unit of process.   (ex.excel , typing formula, error correction)

                                  excel- main process, typing formula -sub process, error -sub process
                                       
                                       here sub process is a Thread.
- Thread is a Task.

- There are two ways to create Thread.
1. Thread Class
2. Runnable Interface.

- Thread is a java inbuilt class.
(import java.lang.Thread)
- Runnable is a java inbuilt interface.

- multi task (same time --> working word,audio,....)

- public static void main(String args[])  // main is one Thread.
{

}
